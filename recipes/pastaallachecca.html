		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>During the summer season, when succulent tomatoes are at the pinnacle of their ripeness, Rome locals</br>
			have a particular affinity for a pasta dish renowned for its simple, fresh ingredients and uncompromised</br>
			flavors. Add to this, that Pasta alla Checca is the easiest pasta dish on the planet to make. No joke!</p>
		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>300 grams of Fusilli Pasta Liguori</li>
			<li>500 grams of Cherry tomatoes</li>
			<li>2 Buffalo mozzarella</li>
			<li>Pecorino cheese as much as preferred</li>
			<li>2 garlic cloves</li>
			<li>Basil leaves as much as preferred</li>
			<li>Extra virgin olive oil EVOO</li>
			<li>Salt & pepper as much as required</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Steps</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Cut cherry tomatoes in half and add them to a large bowl.</li></p>
			<li>Gently squeeze the tomatoes with a potato masher to get the juice out of them.</li></p>
			<li>Break basil leaves into small pieces and add them to the bowl.</li></p>
			<li>Add a generous amount of salt and pepper to the bowl and give everything a nice stir.</li></p>
			<li>Add a tablespoon of rock salt or sea salt to a pot of boiling water and boil the pasta</br>
				according to package instructions. Make sure to give it a quick stir to prevent the pasta</br>
				from sticking to the bottom of the pan.</li></p>
			<li>Strain the pasta, let it cool, and drizzle some EVOO to prevent it from sticking together.</li></p>
			<li>Cut buffalo mozzarella and pecorino cheese into bite-sized cubes, add half of them to the</br>
				tomato mixture, and mix everything until the tomatoes, the juices, and the cheese meld together.</li></p>
			<li>Add pasta to the bowl and quickly mix everything to let the pasta absorb all the juices.</li></p>
			<li>Add the rest of the cheeses with a finishing touch of basil. Serve and Enjoy!</li>
