		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>Spaghetti carbonara recipe is original and approved by Romans! Before we start, the number one</br>
			rule is simple:
			REAL SPAGHETTI CARBONARA RECIPE IS MADE WITH EGGS, NOT CREAM!</p>
		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>5 L Water</li>
			<li>Pinch Rock salt</li>
			<li>300 grams of Spaghetti, Spaghettoni, Rigatoni or Paccheri</li>
			<li>150 grams of Guanciale, Pig Cheek or Pancetta</li>
			<li>200 grams of Pecorino cheese</li>
			<li>4 Eggs</li>
			<li>Pepper</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Steps</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Spaghetti carbonara takes just a short time to make so first up, boil the water to cook your pasta in a large pot.</li></p>
			<li>Cook the pasta according to the packet instructions when it comes to time, making sure the pasta is al dente.</li></p>
			<li>Cut the skin off the guanciale (making sure to leave the peppery/seasoned crust), then slice it into thin strips.</li></p>
			<li>Put the large fry pan on the stove at a low to medium heat. For the spaghetti carbonara recipe to be just right,</br>
				add the guanciale into the pan, let it cook very slowly and it will create its own delicious oil.</li></p>
			<li>Let the guanciale simmer and crisp up very gently.</li></p>
			<li>Get your mixing bowl and add 4 eggs, then whisk them really well.</li></p>
			<li>Next, add the pecorino cheese to make this spaghetti carbonara recipe, and lots of pepper before mixing it</br>
				together really well. This will create a scrumptious cream for you to add to your pasta.</li></p>
			<li>Once the pasta has boiled to your preferred taste, using a set of tongs, take out the pasta from the boiling</br>
				water and add it straight to the pan, making sure small drops of the water mix into the pan too.</li></p>
			<li>Turn off the cook top, so the pasta and guanciale stop cooking.</li></p>
			<li>Next, using the ladle, get a full scoop of pasta water out of the pot and add it to the egg and cheese cream,</br>
				then mix through well using a fork.</li></p>
			<li>Now, turn the cook top back on a low heat, add some pasta water to the pan, and now, pour the cream over the top,</br>
				then mix it through using your tongs and be gentle, but fast! Let it cook through but don't let the eggs scramble</br>
				or you will end up with a frittata!</li></p>
			<li>Keep mixing the cream through until it just starts to thicken, stir is through and then serve.</li></p>
			<li>E ora si mangia..Enjoy!</li>
